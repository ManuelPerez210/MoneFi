# MoneFi
A Dynamic fintech platform that bridges the financial gap for minority and underprivileged business owners by providing connections to lenders, regardless of their credit score, and offers supportive educational services like professional accounting and bookkeeping. This repository provides a glimpse into the project's functionality and architecture through carefully selected code snippets.

As a software engineer, my responsibility was to implement the lectures page for admins and users. I also worked on appointments, blog, and course pages handling all coding tasks from backend to frontend. I designed and developed data models, APIs, and database interactions, while also creating intuitive data visualization components.

Features

- Lectures page of the education hub
- Appointment settings
- Blog features
- Course detail navBar

Tasks

Created a webpage for course lectures in which users and admins can view a paginated result of lectures. 
Admin and users can filter through lectures with a search bar. 
Used react to create webpage in which admin and users can view lectures and get lecture details.
Ensured the responsiveness, performance, and security of the lectures page.
Changed a proc in the back end to change the order of the incoming appointments to be from newest to oldest.
Inserted a placeholder image for blogs to not show broken image when creating a new blog. 
Set up a sweet alert to display a warning when creating a blog without a cover image to let admin know that a placeholder image will be displayed until ready to insert a cover image for blog.
Conducted testing and troubleshooting to fix the course details page from breaking when clicking on the Navbar. Admin/User can now click on the Navbar and not worry about page breaking. Also noticed propType issues in console and took care of those. Modified a couple of files to fix the issues.
Conducted thorough testing and debugging to identify and resolve any issues or bugs.
Utilized best practices and followed coding standards to maintain high-quality code.
Implemented security measures to only allow admins to be able to create, update and delete lectures.
*Please note that MoneFi is currently a Minimal Viable Product and due to proprietary restrictions, I can only provide code snippets in this repository.
