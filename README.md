# MoneFi
A Dynamic fintech platform that bridges the financial gap for minority and underprivileged business owners by providing connections to lenders, regardless of their credit score, and offers supportive educational services like professional accounting and bookkeeping. This repository provides a glimpse into the project's functionality and architecture through carefully selected code snippets.

As a software engineer, my responsibility was to implement the lectures page for admins and users also worked on appointments page, handling all coding tasks from backend to frontend. I designed and developed data models, APIs, and database interactions, while also creating intuitive data visualization components.

Features

- Lectures page of the education hub

- Appointment settings

Used react to create webpage in which admin and users can view lectures and get lecture details.
